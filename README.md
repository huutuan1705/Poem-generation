# POEM GENERATOR
## 1. Introduction
In this project, we will implement a program using a Text Generation model with the theme of generating Vietnamese pentasyllabic poetry (5-word verse) based on an input line provided by the user. Therefore, the Input/Output of the program is as follows:
• Input: A string consisting of 5 words (representing the first line of the poem).
• Output: n subsequent lines of the poem (n is adjustable)
With the poetry generation model, we will build it using a transformer model (utilizing both the encoder and decoder components).

## 2. Prepare dataset
### 2.1. Collect data
For poetry data, there are many websites that compile Vietnamese and international poetry. However, in this project, we will collect pentasyllabic poems from the website [thivien.net](https://www.thivien.net/), a large site dedicated to compiling various genres of Vietnamese poetry
